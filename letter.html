      To my Kitkit,

      Hi baby, I know your mad at me and you hate me. Hate me it's alright its my fault anyway. You know&mdash;I hate myself for letting you to feel that way. I know I'm irresponsible, it's my mistake. I can't stop throwing many excuses, it's just seem I'm selfish. I don't want you to think that this is breaking again&mdash;of what we've done together. You missed someone already and I know it's really my fault. It's true, "ang kapal ng mukha ko". I was you know&mdash;making the mood lighter because your mad. I don't want to hear or see you saying some bad stuffs on me&mdash;not because of me but because of you. I know that your controlling your emotions and you want to take a step ahead. Im there for you. But now it was my mistake, I make you feel that way. I want to apologize for these actions you know? I just feel doing some excuse when I says the reason about it and I don't want to do that. I guess I lost you again for this time. HAHAHAH how many times I will lose you anyway? It's just me—the problem is me. I want to say to you that I never had a thought not doing what we want, like the md stuff. I really want to do it but I make excuses like "ye I can do it later night" but not now. I know I've hurt your feelings. I want you to be with me again baby. I know what you feel and I deserve this. I deserve not getting you because of my mistakes. Ye thats literally my weird mind talking to me when you mention breaking up like the other day. I was sure that I have no chance if I was the only one who will carry this relationship, but I realize it's my mistake&mdash;I've never got a use to you, I always make you angry because I'm mad too. But thats my mistake, I'm suppose to be the one who takes this relationship up, I'm a man on this relationship. So for that I'm really sorry for what of my mind did. Stop the excuse&mdash;It's really my fault for you to feel that way. I make this website just for you. So that I can apologize to you in a unique way. I'm still no better at coding but I did try my best hehe :> . You know that I love you, I will never cheat on you, I will never get your feelings down, I will always take care of you. You hear it? The song? Listen to the lyrics and you know why that song is what I've chosen. You are a baby for me, a child who wants something, and thats me. Your my baby, your always the clumsy baby I've know. And the almost prettiest, gorgeous, beautiful baby I've known. If you want to know if I cried last day because of something we're fighting for? You know what's the answer for that. I'm going to make you more website soon as I learn many things. I hope you will appreciate this website as a unique letter for me. I love you always Kitkit ;)
